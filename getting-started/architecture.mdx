## Component overview

### MCP client

- The entry point of the system
- Initiates WebSocket connections
- Sends code execution requests
- Receives execution results and approvals

### MCP server

- Central orchestration component
- Manages WebSocket communication
- Handles tool registration and execution
- Coordinates between desktop client and approver
- Manages security tokens and code evaluation workflow

### **Approver Client**

- Provides human-in-the-loop security mechanism
- Receives and processes approval requests
- Enables interactive decision-making for code execution, and code execution responses
- Sends approval/rejection responses

### **Code Execution Environment**

- Indvidual, secure, GitHub Codespace
- Executes interpolated and evaluated code
- Provides isolated execution context
- Returns execution results

## Workflow steps

1. **Initiation**: MCP connects via WebSocket
2. **Planning**: User creates a planning token
3. **Evaluation**: Code is security evaluated
4. **Approval**: Approver reviews and decides
5. **Execution**: Code runs in codespace
6. **Review**: User reviews and decides to send back response
7. **Response**: Result returned to MCP Client

## **Security Mechanisms**

- WebSocket token-based authentication
- Interactive human approval
- Isolated code execution environments
- Encryption of messages
- Single-use planning and execution tokens

## **Key Technologies**

- WebSocket for real-time communication
- GitHub Codespaces for secure execution
- Token-based security model
- Zod for runtime type validation

## **Configuration**

The system is highly configurable with options for:

- WebSocket connection parameters
- Reconnection strategies
- Approval timeout settings
- Encryption preferences
