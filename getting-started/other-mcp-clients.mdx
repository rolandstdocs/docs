## Installation & setup for Cursor, Vs Code, and other MCP clients

### Step 1: Clone and Build the keyboard MCP server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/keyboard-dev/keyboard-mcp
cd keyboard-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Complete desktop onboarding

**Important**: Before configuring any editor, complete the desktop onboarding:

1. Download and run the Keyboard desktop app if you haven't already (download [here](https://github.com/keyboard-dev/approver-client/releases/tag/v0.0.9))
2. Complete the onboarding flow to automatically create your GitHub credentials and WebSocket key

**After onboarding**: You can leave environment variables blank in your MCP configurations.

## MCP client configuration

Use these configurations with **any MCP client** that accepts JSON:

### Cursor

Create `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keyboard": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/keyboard-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "keyboard": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/keyboard-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop and Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keyboard": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/keyboard-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then you if you want to add it to claude code you can just run this command:

```
claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop 
```

### Any other MCP client

For any MCP client that accepts JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "keyboard": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/keyboard-mcp/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Manual environment setup (if needed)

If you want to use environment variables:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keyboard": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/keyboard-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PAT_TOKEN": "your_github_token_here",
        "SOCKET_KEY": "your_socket_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
